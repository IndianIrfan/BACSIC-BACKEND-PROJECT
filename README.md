# BASIC-BACKEND-PROJECT
BASIC BACKEND PROJECT FOR UNDERSTANDING OF ROUTING CONCEPT


   Backend Basic Project README
* This project is a basic backend application aimed at understanding routing using Express, which is a framework for Node.js. Additionally, the project is connected to a MongoDB database. Below are the key points about this project:

* Purpose: To learn and demonstrate basic backend routing concepts using Express and database connectivity with MongoDB.
* Language and Framework Used:
* Programming Language: Javascript
* Framework: Express.js (Node.js)
* Database Connection:
* Connected to MongoDB database.
* Demonstrates basic CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) with the database.
* Routing Features:
* Implemented basic routing for handling different HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) using Express.
* Demonstrates routing for different endpoints or URLs.
* Utilizes middleware for request handling and response generation in Express.
    How to Use:
* Clone the repository to your local machine.
* Install any necessary dependencies.
* Set up and configure the MongoDB database connection.
* Run the application using [npx nodemon].
* Test the routing and database operations by sending HTTP requests to various endpoints using tools like Postman or cURL.
     Additional Notes:
* Ensure that MongoDB is installed and running on your local machine or provide connection details to a remote MongoDB instance.
